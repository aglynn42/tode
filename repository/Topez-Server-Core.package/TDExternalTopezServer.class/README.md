External tODE server.

Expect tODE to be installed in a UserProfile in the stone. tODE does not have to be installed in the application environment. This class is used when the userId and todeUserId are not the same in a TDSessionDescription.

If the application environment includes the tDOE globals, then a TDTopezServer should be used.

To do development in a stone without a full tODE installation, you have the option of installing a minimal tODE development environment that provides a mimial set of functionality (not implemented yet  - see https://github.com/feenkcom/gt4gemstone)
