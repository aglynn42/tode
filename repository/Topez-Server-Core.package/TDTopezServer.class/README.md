Standard tODE server. 

Expect tODE to be installed/available within the application environment.

If application environment does not include tODE globals, but tODE is installed in the same stone as the application as a separate user, then TDExternalTopezServer should be used.

To do development in a stone without a full tODE installation, you have the option of installing a minimal tODE development environment that provides a mimial set of functionality (not implemented yet  - see https://github.com/feenkcom/gt4gemstone)
